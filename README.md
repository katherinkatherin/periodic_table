Hereâ€™s how you can describe the different files of your periodic table project in a README format:

# Interactive Periodic Table

This project is a web-based interactive periodic table that allows users to explore chemical elements by clicking on their respective symbols. It provides details about each element and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

### `index.html`
This is the main HTML file that structures the page layout. It includes the following components:
- **Header:** Displays the title "Interactive Periodic Table".
- **Main Section:** Contains a grid of clickable buttons representing elements, each showing the atomic number and symbol.
- **Element Box:** An area where information about the selected element is displayed when a user clicks on an element button.

### `styles.css`
This file styles the periodic table and overall page layout, including:
- **Element Styling:** Color codes the element buttons based on their category (e.g., nonmetals, noble gases).
- **Grid Layout:** Defines the periodic table's layout, ensuring proper alignment and spacing of element buttons.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures that the layout adapts to different screen sizes, making the table interactive on both desktop and mobile devices.

### `script.js`
This file handles the interactivity of the periodic table. It includes:
- **Event Listeners:** Detects when a user clicks on an element button and dynamically updates the element details in the information box.
- **Data Binding:** Connects each button to its corresponding atomic number and element properties, making the user interaction seamless.
  
### `server.js`
This file sets up a simple Node.js server to serve the web application. It includes:
- **Express Setup:** Initializes an Express server to serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS).
- **Port Configuration:** Configures the server to listen on a specified port, allowing local and potentially remote access to the web app.
